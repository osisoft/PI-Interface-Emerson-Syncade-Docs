Catalog files are separate downloadable files, and are used for application whitelisting. If you use whitelisting, install the catalog files associated with your OSIsoft products to ensure that those products function as intended. Windows catalog files that have been digitally signed by OSIsoft can be used as a digital signature for 3rd party and other unsigned components installed by OSIsoft setup kits. This facilitates a trusted way to verify these components and may be used for whitelisting purposes. For information on how to use catalog files for whitelisting, refer to the OSIsoft Knowledge Base article: [Whitelisting PI applications based on catalog files](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/knowledgearticle?knowledgeArticleUrl=KB01975).
