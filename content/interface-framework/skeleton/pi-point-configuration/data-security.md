# Data Security

The PI identity in the PI trust that authenticates the interface must be granted read access to the DataSecurity attribute of every PI point that the interface services. If the interface is used without a buffering application, write access also must be granted. (If the interface is used with a buffering application, the buffering application requires write access but the interface does not.)
