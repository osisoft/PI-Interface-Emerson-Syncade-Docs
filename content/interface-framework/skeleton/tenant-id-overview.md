# TenantID Overview

In the OCS configuration, the TenantID identifies the tenant to which the OMF health data belongs.

Examples, from the config file samples provided in this user guide:

* `TenantID=MyTenantID`
* `TenantID=abc12345-d6e7-8f9a-1b2c34567891`
* `TenantID=def15987-d7f8-8d9b-1c4e38468716`

The user receives the TenantID when an OCS account is created.
