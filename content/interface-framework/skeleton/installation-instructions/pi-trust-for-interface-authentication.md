# PI trust for interface authentication

A PI Interface usually runs on an interface computer as a Windows service, which is a non-interactive environment. In order for an interface to authenticate itself to a PI Data Archive and obtain the access permissions for proper operation, the PI Data Archive must have a PI trust that matches the connection credentials of the interface. For more information on interface security and PI trusts, refer to the [PI Universal Interface (UniInt) Framework User Guide](https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/web/pub.xql?action=publist_home&pub_category=PI-Universal-Interface-(UniInt)-Framework).
