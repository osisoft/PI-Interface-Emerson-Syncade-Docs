# PointType (data type)

PointType specifies the data type of the point. Typically, item data types do not need to match PI point data types exactly, but the data types must be compatible. For example, integer values from a device can be sent to floating-point or digital PI tags. Similarly, a floating-point value from the device can be sent to integer or digital PI points, although the values might be truncated.
