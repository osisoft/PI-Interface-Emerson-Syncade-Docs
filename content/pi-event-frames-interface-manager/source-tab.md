<!-- Mark Bishop 6/18/21: Customized for Emerson Syncade -->

<!-- Content below applies to all interfaces -->

Configure the data sources that you want the interface to read. To add a data source, right-click the top **Sources** node and choose the **Add** option for the type of source you are configuring. After you add the first data source, all additional data sources must be the same type (event journal or SQL database).

<!-- Custom content for interface below -->

**Note:** To use explicit logins for an SQL data source, ensure that the user running the interface and the user configuring the interface are the same user. Database user name and Password are encrypted and stored in Windows Credential Manager. For details, see <xref:BIF_WindowsCredentialManagerAuthentication>.
