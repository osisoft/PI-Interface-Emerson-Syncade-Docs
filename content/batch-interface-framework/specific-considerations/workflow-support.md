# Workflow support

<!-- Mark Bishop 6/18/21: Customized for Emerson Syncade -->

PI Interface for Emerson Syncade Batch supports Syncade Work Flow 4.6 and Syncade Work Flow 4.9. The interface supports only one version of Work Flow per instance, unless specifically set using the /WorkFlow46 command line parameter. The interface defaults to Syncade Work Flow 4.9.

The interface can capture Syncade batches, including manual phase steps (using tag and property templates) from data sources and from Syncade web services (historical data) and the Microsoft Message Queue (real-time data).
