# How batch data is stored

<!-- Customized for syncade -->

PI Interface for Emerson Syncade Batch stores batch data as PI AF event frames. The interface represents equipment by creating PI AF assets. PI AF event frames and elements provide a highly flexible, general-purpose structure that enables you to define your asset model and event hierarchy as you wish. Event frames do not restrict the number of unit batches that can be active in the same unit at the same time.
