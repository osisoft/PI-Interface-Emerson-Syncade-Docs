# Introduction to PI Interface for <interface name>

<!-- This is an interface-specific skeleton topic. UPDATE WITH INFORMATION FOR YOUR INTERFACE. -->

The PI Interface for Relational Databases enables you to transfer data between the PI Data Archive and any relational database management system (RDBMS) that supports Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers. The interface runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems and can connect to any PI Server node available on the network. To read and write data, you define SQL queries in the ExDesc attribute of a PI tag or in text files. The interface provides the following capabilities:

* Update PI tags from data in an RDBMS
* Update an RDMBS with PI tag data
* Record changes to PI tag attributes in an RDBMS
