# Appendix B: Error and informational messages

Messages are logged to the local PI message log during interface startup, data collection and recover. Additional messages are logged if you enable debugging. The log also contains messages from the UniInt framework and the PI API (on which this interface is based), and the buffering program. For detailed information about interface logging, see the following OSIsoft Knowledge Base topic: http://techsupport.osisoft.com/Support+Solution/8/KB00401.html.
