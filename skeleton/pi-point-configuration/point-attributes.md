# Point attributes

Point attributes are dependent upon the configuration of your interface. Use the point attributes below to define the PI point configuration for the interface, and to identify the data you wish to transfer.

UniInt provides exception reporting, while PI Data Archive or PIBufss provides data compression. Both are important aspects of data collection and archiving.
    
**Note:** See the [PI Universal Interface (UniInt) Framework User Guide](https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/web/pub.xql?action=publist_home&pub_category=PI-Universal-Interface-(UniInt)-Framework) for information on configuring PI Data Archive processing for a PI point, as well as for detail on point attributes that are significant to PI point data collection and archiving. Additional information on PI Point attributes and classes is available in the [PI Server documentation](https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/web/pub.xql?action=publist_home&pub_category=PI-Server), where you can identify your server version and then view the topic Point classes and attributes.
