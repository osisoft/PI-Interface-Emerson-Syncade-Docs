# Install interface as Windows service

The interface service can be created, preferably, with the PI Interface Configuration Utility, or can be created manually.
    
**Note:** For improved security, we recommend running the interface service under a non-administrative account, such as a Windows built-in service virtual account, the built-in Network Service account, or a non-administrative account that you create.
